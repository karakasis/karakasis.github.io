#### The concept behind the game

If you have ever played a game with a static environment, whether thatâ€™s
an open world game or a level based game, with a moderate amount of
difficulty, you have probably stumbled on the same area or level a few times.
There are times where a certain area is so difficult to beat or progress from,
that you catch yourself trying to memorize the location of the enemies or
patterns within that area in order to find a strategy to beat your current
objective. Alternatively, its not uncommon for someone to replay a game that
they finished in their childhood and realize that they know certain areas or
aspects of the game like the back of their palm. This can often be described as
muscle memory or flashbacks that were buried in our memory until a stimulus
triggered by the environment brings back that memory. Another application
of this can be seen in games like Pokemon, Zelda, Mario or newer titles like
Dark Souls, Skyrim or The Witcher, where you have memorized where to find
items, quest givers, exits for dungeons or even pixels in the ground where you
have to jump in order to reach a platform. All of the aforementioned have
a common axis where they intersect, and that is memory, which proves that
through repeated interaction with an entity you become accustomed to it
and able to recall actions that you made in a previous time. That is the
basic concept behind the proposed game in this thesis, in conjunction with
the Method of Loci, as described earlier
