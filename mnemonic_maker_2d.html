         If you have ever played a game with a static environment, whether thatâ€™s an open world game or a level based game, with a moderate amount of difficulty, you have probably stumbled on the same area or level a few times. There are times where a certain area is so difficult to beat or progress from, that you catch yourself trying to memorize the location of the enemies or patterns within that area in order to find a strategy to beat your current objective. Alternatively, its not uncommon for someone to replay a game that they finished in their childhood and realize that they know certain areas or aspects of the game like the back of their palm. This can often be described as muscle memory or flashbacks that were buried in our memory until a stimulus triggered by the environment brings back that memory. Another application of this can be seen in games like Pokemon, Zelda, Mario or newer titles like Dark Souls, Skyrim or The Witcher, where you have memorized where to find items, quest givers, exits for dungeons or even pixels in the ground where you have to jump in order to reach a platform. All of the aforementioned have a common axis where they intersect, and that is memory, which proves that through repeated interaction with an entity you become accustomed to it and able to recall actions that you made in a previous time. That is the basic concept behind the proposed game in this thesis, in conjunction with the Method of Loci, as described earlier
