         If you have ever played a game with a static environment, whether thatâ€™s an open world game or a level based game, with a moderate amount of difficulty, you have probably stumbled on the same area or level a few times. There are times where a certain area is so difficult to beat or progress from, that you catch yourself trying to memorize the location of the enemies or patterns within that area in order to find a strategy to beat your current objective. Alternatively, its not uncommon for someone to replay a game that they finished in their childhood and realize that they know certain areas or aspects of the game like the back of their palm. This can often be described as muscle memory or flashbacks that were buried in our memory until a stimulus triggered by the environment brings back that memory. Another application of this can be seen in games like Pokemon, Zelda, Mario or newer titles like Dark Souls, Skyrim or The Witcher, where you have memorized where to find items, quest givers, exits for dungeons or even pixels in the ground where you have to jump in order to reach a platform. All of the aforementioned have a common axis where they intersect, and that is memory, which proves that through repeated interaction with an entity you become accustomed to it and able to recall actions that you made in a previous time. That is the basic concept behind the proposed game in this thesis, in conjunction with the Method of Loci, as described earlier

                <p>In the 2 YouTube videos below, you can see a showcase of the game using both mods. In the first video I will be entering my mnemonic phrase, that I want to memorize in game. For the purpose of demonstration I will be getting a random mnemonic phrase of 12 words generated from <a href="https://iancoleman.io/bip39/">Mnemonic Code Converter</a>. Then I will be utilizing the Pathfinding tool inside the game, along side the game map to find the locations of the items that recreate my mnemonic phrase. After the recording of the first video, I spent some time repeating the process until I felt comfortable enough to throw away my mnemonic phrase, leaving me only the option to recreate my mnemonic through playing the game on the normal mode. In the second video (make sure to enable subtitles since I will be going over my actions in my native language), I am starting over this time selecting normal game mode, in which the game itself has no recollection of who I am or what my mnemonic might be. The game world is set and static for every user and will always remain the same and there is no data saved locally from previous attempts. In the normal game mode, the player is allowed to collect whichever item he wishes, and only when every slot in the inventory is filled, then the player has the option to extract a mnemonic phrase based on which items were collected, as well as the order that they were collected. As showcased in the second video, I was able to find all the items without the assistance of the game, purely using my memory and tricks that helped me remember the location and order of my items. The process of collecting the items in normal mode took approximatelly 7 minutes.</p>
